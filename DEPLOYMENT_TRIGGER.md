# ðŸš€ Barberng - Fresh Build Trigger

This file exists to force a fresh deployment and clear any cached configurations.

Deployment timestamp: 2025-09-15
Build version: Clean deployment without vercel.json
Status: Force new build to resolve runtime configuration issues

## Environment Check
- âœ… vercel.json removed
- âœ… Next.js 15.5.3 
- âœ… No custom function runtimes
- âœ… Using Vercel defaults

This should resolve the "Function Runtimes must have a valid version" error.
